Hi, Curious Being! ðŸ‘‹

The program you see in this repo is a simple command line tool(CLI) built in Golang. I heard Go makes it super easy to create custom CLIs. Gave it a shot.

## What can I do with StringWizard CLI?

You can directly input a text as a command in the terminal window and evaluate it on the basis of certain metrics. 

Example:
```
$ stringwizard --text "How you doin'?"
Your string has 15 chars
```
